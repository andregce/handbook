# RunJS

RunJS is an application that allows us to run and inspect JavaScript/TypeScript
code. It is useful for trying out new features, working through parts of an
algorithm for a project or a codewar, or just analyzing why some
JavaScript/TypeScript code doesn't work.

## Installation

Visit [https://runjs.app/](https://runjs.app/) and download/install for the
platform of your choice.

# Firefox

We recommend using [Firefox](https://firefox.com) during this course.

We are going to be using Firefox's `Development Tools` feature extensively when
developing front-end applications. Even if you do not use Firefox for your web
browsing experience, having all of your fellow students on the same development
tools will help.

## Installation

<OperatingSystemSwitch allowedOperatingSystems={['Mac']}>

```shell
brew install --cask firefox
```

</OperatingSystemSwitch>

<OperatingSystemSwitch allowedOperatingSystems={['Windows']}>

```shell
scoop install firefox
```

</OperatingSystemSwitch>

# Prettier

Developing a clean writing style is just as important when writing code as it is
when writing prose. To help us with developing this style, we can use an
automatic code formatter. This will ensure that our code is formatted with the
proper indentation and the correct placement of syntax.

We will be using the `prettier` formatter for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
code.

## Installation

From Terminal, and in any directory, run the following command:

```shell
npm install --global prettier
```

# vite

Check [this](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vite) for the pronunciation. It
is pronounced to rhyme with _meat_.

This is a tool we use to generate our web projects, run our code, and generate a
production version that we will deploy to `Netlify`.

## Installation

From Terminal, and in any directory, run the following command:

```shell
npm install --global vite
```

# degit

This is the tool we will use to download the templates we will customize for
ourselves. It is a general tool that can download a git repository to your
computer and allow you to make a new git/GitHub history for it.

## Installation

From Terminal, and in any directory, run the following command:

```shell
npm install --global degit
```
